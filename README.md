# Generative-AI-GANs-in-Natural-Language-Processing-Text-Generation-and-Style-Transfer-
Sure! Below is a simple example of how you can implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for text generation and style transfer using Python and the TensorFlow library. This example will use the TensorFlow library's Keras API, which provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks.
